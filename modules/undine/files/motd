Welcome to Undine!

SSH agent forwarding is enabled by default. You may use any SSH keys made
available on your host system, without manually transferring them here.

Port 80 (http) on this VM is forwarded to port 8080 on your host by default.
Likewise, port 443 (https) on the VM is forwarded to host port 8443.

Your www directory on the host is shared with /var/www on the VM by default.

If you want to use XHProf with devel, the directory is /usr/share/php53-xhprof.
By default, XHProf runs are accessible at http://localhost:8080/xhprof_html.
